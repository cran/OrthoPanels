Description: Implements the orthogonal reparameterization
    approach recommended by Lancaster (2002) to estimate dynamic panel
    models with fixed effects (and optionally: panel specific
    intercepts). The approach uses a likelihood-based estimator and
    produces estimates that are asymptotically unbiased as N goes to
    infinity, with a T as low as 2.
